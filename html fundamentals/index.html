        <p>
          Picking a workout routine to follow can be a difficult task with all
          the different information out there about workout styles. I went
          through thousands of minutes of youtube videos and articles to find
          which one will work for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did a trial and error for all types of workout routine there is and
          I found myself to like the <em>Push-Pull-Leg</em> routine. What is it?
          I will explain in this post.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Push-Pull-Leg Routine</h3>

        <p>
          The <strong>P</strong>ush-<strong>P</strong>ull-<strong>L</strong>eg
          routine aka PPL is one of the popular routines for gym heads in the
          fitness world. It is basically working your Pushing muscles, pulling
          muscles, and your leg muscles on different days. You focus on each
          muscle group per gym per gym session. There are other types of gym
          routines out there which you can follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pushing muscles are primarily your chest, triceps, and shoulders.
          They are engaged when you push objects. Chest press, military press,
          tricep extension and so on work the push groups. The pulling muscles
          are your biceps, back, traps, and lats.There really is no end to the
          exercises you can do to work these muscle group. And finally your leg
          muscles, primarily the quads, hamstring, calves, hips, adductors, and
          the myriad of other muscles your leg uses. They can be worked on by
          doing squats, leg press, calf raises (seated and standing), lunges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why do I need three different days to work these muscles? Well you
          don't, It is your prefrence how you want to build your workout
          routine. Like I said earlier in the post there are other routines that
          are widely known, and you can choose from these also. They are;
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Push-Pull-Leg</li>
          <li>Gym Bros routine</li>
          <li>Full body workout</li>
          <li>Upper Lower</li>
          <li>Personalised Workout</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why PPL?</h3>

        <p>
          PPL is for those who have the time to go everyday. If your job or
          schedule doesn't permit you going 4-5 days a week the PPL isn't for
          you. The full body workout routine is more on your scale if you can
          only go 2-3 times.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is what one of my 3 day PPL routine looks like (set and reps not
          included)
        </p>
